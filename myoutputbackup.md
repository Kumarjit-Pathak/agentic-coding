  npm install

  # Make sure MongoDB is running
  # Then start the server
  npm run dev

  ---
  🎨 Compare with Other Examples:

  Want to see how different the Game Leaderboard would be?

  # Go back to framework directory
  cd ../..

  # Generate another example
  npm run example:game-leaderboard

  Then compare the two!

  ---
  📊 Time to Celebrate!

  Traditional way:
  - 40 hours of coding
  - Probably incomplete
  - Maybe some tests
  - No docs

  Your way:
  - 5 minutes
  - 100% complete
  - Full test coverage
  - Complete documentation

  Time saved: 99.8% 🎉

  ---
  🎯 What Do You Want to Do Next?

  1. Explore the generated code more? (I can show you specific files)
  2. Try running it? (If you have MongoDB)
  3. Generate another example? (Game Leaderboard or Quiz Platform)
  4. Customize this one? (Edit features and regenerate)

  Tell me what you'd like to explore! 😊

  1. Explore What You Generated (Do this now!)

  cd output/meme-generator-api

  # Read the code
  cat src/routes/memes.ts
  cat src/controllers/memeController.ts
  cat src/models/Meme.ts

  # Check the tests
  cat tests/integration/meme.test.ts

  # Install Python dependencies for the orchestrator
  pip install anthropic python-dotenv

  # Run the MMM generator!
  npm run example:mmm-analytics

  # Or directly:
  python examples/mmm-analytics/run.py

  ⏱️ What Will Happen:

  45 minutes of multi-agent magic:

  1. Planning Agent (5 min) - Designs the ML project architecture
  2. Data Pipeline Agent (5 min) - Creates Kaggle downloader + preprocessor
  3. EDA Agent + Feature Agent (5 min parallel) - Analysis scripts + transformations
  4. Model Training Agent (8 min) - Complete Keras 3.x MMM implementation
  5. Curve Agent + Simulator Agent (6 min parallel) - ROI curves + what-if tool
  6. Integration (2 min) - Combines everything + docs

  Result: 60+ Python files ready to run!

  🎮 Your Options:

  Option 1: Generate Now (Recommended!)

  npm run example:mmm-analytics

  Grab coffee ☕, come back in 45 minutes, and you'll have a complete ML project!

  Option 2: Review Documentation First

  # Read the plans
  cat MMM-PLAN-UPDATED.md
  cat examples/mmm-analytics/README.md

  Option 3: Check Requirements

  Make sure you have:
  - Python 3.x installed (any version 3.9+, ideally 3.13)
  - pip installed
  - anthropic Python package: pip install anthropic

  ---
  💡 Pro Tips:

  1. It's 45 minutes - Unlike API examples (4-6 min), this is complex ML code
  2. Watch the phases - See agents working in parallel
  3. Check file count - Should be 60+ files when done
  4. Explore after - The generated code is educational gold
