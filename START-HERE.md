## 🏆 The Goal

Transform from this:

```
Developer: *starts coding without planning*
Hours later: *still debugging, half-done, stressed*
```

To this:

```
Developer: *uses framework*
Minutes later: *complete, tested, documented, deployed*
```

## 🌟 Remember

**The Three Rules:**

1. **Plan before you code**
   - Use thinking mode
   - Break down tasks
   - Identify dependencies

2. **Use specialized agents**
   - One agent per responsibility
   - Parallel where possible
   - Sequential when needed

3. **Never vibe code (complex tasks)**
   - Structure beats chaos
   - Quality over speed
   - Tested over "works on my machine"

---

## 🚀 Let's Go!

You have everything you need:

- ✅ Complete tutorial
- ✅ Working framework
- ✅ Live examples
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ Your API key is ready

**Now it's your turn.**

Run this command and watch the magic:

```bash
cd anti-vibe-framework && npm install && npm run example:todo-api
```

---

**See you on the other side!** 🎉

Where code is structured, agents are working, and vibes are... well, non-existent (in coding). 😌

---

*P.S. After you run your first example, come back and explore the tutorial. The deeper you go, the more powerful you become!*

*Happy building!* 🚀
